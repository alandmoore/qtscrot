Requirements
============

- scrot
- Python

Usage
=====

Launch qtscrot with this command::

    python qtscrot.py

Obviously you may want to bind that to a keyboard shortcut (like printscrn) or make a desktop icon for it.

Configure the type of screenshot you want, then hit "take screenshot" (or alt-T).  You'll see a scaled-down preview of your shot.
Hit ctrl-S to save this screenshot.
